# MuLERMoCs — Organic Nomenclature Learning Platform

A Greek-first interactive learning platform for organic nomenclature, built around molecular structure, naming logic, and multiple representations.

**Current working baseline:** v41
**Main entry point:** [mulermoc-nom-41.html](mulermoc-nom-41.html)
**Core engine:** [js/mulermoc-nom-core-41.js](js/mulermoc-nom-core-41.js)
**Viewer layer:** [js/mulermoc-nom-molview-41.js](js/mulermoc-nom-molview-41.js)
**Teaching layer:** [js/mulermoc-nom-teaching-41.js](js/mulermoc-nom-teaching-41.js)
**Data set:** [js/jsme-nick-nomeclature-moc2-data_41.js](js/jsme-nick-nomeclature-moc2-data_41.js) — 64 molecules

## Recent work: ethers (v40)

- First ether molecules: `ethyl_methyl_ether` (CH3OCH2CH3) and `dimethylether` (CH3OCH3), classified into the `Αιθέρες` menu group.
- Systematic naming (alkoxy prefix + parent alkane, e.g. μεθοξυαιθάνιο) and common naming (e.g. αιθυλμεθυλαιθέρας), with an IUPAC/COMMON toggle in the name-explanation panel.
- Per-component highlight and numbering: alkoxy/alkyl clicks highlight and number only their own chain; `αιθέρας` highlights C-O-C.
- Tolerant 2D loading: molecules with a missing representation load the first available one and disable the corresponding mode radio instead of crashing.

---

## Recent work: esters + viewer/menu improvements (v41)

- First ester molecules: `ethanoic_methyl_ester` (CH3COOCH3) and `propanoic_methyl_ester` (CH3CH2COOCH3), with condensed, expanded and skeletal 2D data plus 3D SDFs. They run in algorithmic main-chain mode; stored `mainChain`/`moveto` data remains optional.
- Ester detection in 2D and 3D (`functionalGroupObj.ester`), two-fragment `esterInfo` analysis, and two-word Greek IUPAC naming (e.g. προπανοϊκός μεθυλεστέρας) with ester-aware euphony.
- Ester highlight/numbering: alcohol-fragment click numbers only the alcohol chain; ester-word click highlights the `O-C(=O)-O` triad in 2D and 3D.
- Viewer: `[2D][3D]` title-bar visibility toggles, `Επισήμανση ατόμων κατά την αρίθμηση` setting (on by default), 2D atom colors on by default, molecule info button + panel (disabled by default via `molInfoEnabled = false`).
- Menu: chemical-class taxonomy (`carbonylCompounds`, `esters`; hydroxy/amino acids folded into `carboxylicAcids`), flat `Όλα τα μόρια` grouping mode, rewritten rule-3 table with `data-row` keys.

---

## Recent fix: branch highlighting

The current working branch focuses on the selection logic for alkyl side chains and related expanded hydrogens.

- Selected methyl and other hydrocarbon branches now highlight correctly in both the 2D JSME view and the 3D JSmol view.
- The branch fallback works even when the molecule includes additional functional groups, instead of only pure hydrocarbon cases.
- In expanded 2D mode, the carbon label and the attached hydrogen labels of the selected branch are color-synchronized so the branch remains visually coherent when highlighted.

## Project status

This project is currently a no-build web application built with JSME, JSmol, Snap.svg, and vanilla JavaScript. It already contains a working nomenclature engine and multiple representation modes, but it is still a legacy HTML-based implementation rather than a fully refactored product structure.

The next product iteration is being re-scoped around a clearer educational model:

- Greek-first interface
- homologous series as the primary navigation model
- rules as a secondary explanatory layer
- chemistry expansion in this order: branched molecules → ethers → esters

---

## Current stack

- **jQuery** 3.7.1
- **JSME** — 2D molecule editor/viewer
- **JSmol** — 3D molecule viewer
- **Snap.svg** — SVG manipulation
- **Web Speech API** — Greek TTS narration

---

## What exists now

### Supported baseline
- 2D molecular rendering via JSME
- 3D molecular rendering via JSmol
- Molecule menu grouped by homologous series by default
- Alternate rule-based molecule grouping
- Homologous-series groups ordered by increasing total carbon count
- Group switching preserves the selected molecule and opens its new group
- No molecule is selected when switching groups with no prior selection
- Methane is selected by default on page load
- Multiple representation modes:
  - condensed
  - expanded
  - skeletal
  - annotated skeletal
- Greek IUPAC name generation (incl. ether systematic + common names, two-word ester names)
- Name analysis and explanation panels (per-fragment highlight/numbering, IUPAC/COMMON toggle for ethers)
- Rule theory panel
- TTS narration in Greek
- PNG export for 2D and 3D views
- Responsive menu and settings controls
- Title-bar `[2D][3D]` visibility toggles + highlight-during-numbering setting
- 2D atom colors on by default
- Current molecule data set for the teaching application (64 molecules, incl. 2 ethers + 2 esters)

### Molecule grouping (v39, refined in v41)

The menu classifies molecules through the existing structure-analysis
pipeline (`fAnalyseStructure()` and `fDetectMolType()`). Each molecule receives
a classification snapshot containing its functional groups, homologous-series
key, bond-series type, and total carbon count.

The default menu groups molecules by homologous series. Rule grouping and a
flat `Όλα τα μόρια` (all molecules) list are available as alternate modes.
Chemical classes in v41 include `ethers`, `esters` and `carbonylCompounds`
(merged aldehydes/ketones); hydroxy/amino acids are folded into
`carboxylicAcids`. Remaining special series include keto acids, hydroxy
nitriles, and oxo carboxylic acids.

Within each homologous-series group, molecules are ordered by increasing total
number of carbon atoms. The optional `mainChain` data is not required for this
menu ordering.

### Current implementation architecture
The project uses a split-layer architecture:

- **Core logic**: analysis + naming
- **Viewer layer**: JSME / JSmol / Snap.svg integration
- **Teaching layer**: rule explanations, narration, UI wiring
- **Data layer**: molecule definitions and structural data

This makes the codebase a workable foundation for the restart and expansion.

## Restart and expansion plan

### Product principle
The next version should not be organized primarily around rule-by-rule teaching. Instead, the platform should be organized around:

- homologous series
- molecule browsing by family
- molecule detail view
- naming analysis
- optional rule explanations

### Immediate chemistry roadmap
1. **Branched molecules**
   - alkyl substituent recognition
   - multi-branch chain selection
   - corrected locant logic
   - validation examples

2. **Ethers** (v40, carried into v41)
    - detection and classification: done
    - systematic + common naming for saturated acyclic mono-ethers: done
    - per-component highlight/numbering + IUPAC/COMMON toggle: done
    - second example (`dimethylether`) added; stored chain data and `moveto` remain optional
    - remaining: unsaturated ether chains

3. **Esters** (in progress, v41)
    - detection and classification (2D + 3D): done
    - two-fragment `esterInfo` analysis: done
    - two-word IUPAC naming (e.g. προπανοϊκός μεθυλεστέρας): done
    - per-fragment highlight/numbering + rule-table rows: done
    - first molecules (`ethanoic_methyl_ester`, `propanoic_methyl_ester` with condensed/expanded/skeletal + 3D): done
    - remaining: wider molecule coverage, unsaturated chains

### After the chemistry expansion
- add a first learning interaction layer
- add atom/bond click targets
- add one exploration mode
- then consider quiz features and research instrumentation

---

## Deferred scope

These remain explicitly out of the first restart milestone:

- full research-mode architecture
- participant/session logging
- quiz SPA
- condition locking
- CSV export
- transfer-test data set
- server-side classroom management
- rings and aromatics
- full reaction module

These belong to a later product phase.

## Key project documents

- [DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md)
- [RESEARCH-PLAN.md](docs/RESEARCH-PLAN.md)
- [PROJECT-PLAN.md](docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md)
- [PROJECT-PLAN-GR.md](docs/PROJECT-PLAN-GR.md)
- [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md)

These plans describe the research and product ambitions, but the current implementation should be treated as the working v41 baseline rather than as a fully finished research platform.

---

## Technical notes

### Important observations
- The workspace contains multiple historical versions, including v35-v41 snapshots.
- The project plans still describe older intended milestones and should be reconciled with the real v41 baseline.
- The chemistry engine should be validated before expanding into more complex categories.
- Ester detection/naming/highlight paths are implemented in v41; tertiary-amine detection still needs explicit testing.

---

## Future goal

The target product is not only a naming tool, but a series-based chemistry learning environment that helps students explore:

- molecular family
- naming patterns
- structural logic
- representation transitions
- explanation by structure, not only by rules

This makes the platform more pedagogically coherent and more scalable than a strict rule-first interface.
